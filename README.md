# Library Management System [TEAM 77]

## Overview
This project develops a comprehensive Library Management System focusing on digital library operations. It's designed using a microservices architecture to streamline user and book management processes.

## Features
- **User Management:** Handle user registrations, logins, and profile management.
- **Book Services:** Catalog books, manage inventory, and track borrower records.
- **Review and Message Processing:** Enable users to review books and communicate within the system.

## Technologies
- **Back-End:** Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Messaging:** Kafka
- **Service Discovery:** Eureka

## Architecture
The system uses a microservices architecture, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance. Key components include service discovery, centralized configuration, and distributed tracing.
